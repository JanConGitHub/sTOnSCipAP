sTOnSCipAP is a cheap & cheerful version of Stone, Scissors, Paper.

Written using qml as a further exploration of what can be done with the Ubuntu SDK with only a limited amount of programming knowledge.

It's hardly going to win any prizes but has been quite educational for me and hopefully will be fun for others too - either from playing the actual game or just chuckling at the shoddy code :)
